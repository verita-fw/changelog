The Muro core team is proud to announce that it has released its 15.1
version, nicknamed "Ascending Albatross", of the open source Muro
firewall software.

This is the first release by the Muro project.  Download[1] and try it now!
Be sure to visit the project website[2] and learn more about us and the
project.  The project wants to be a friendly place for users, developers and
partners.

We believe that an open source project should keep its sources and build tools
available for all.  Muro uses the simple 2-clause BSD license.

Users benefit from the polished installer, rich feature set and modern user
interface.  Developers are invited to check out our easy-to-use build tools.
Commercial Support assists in keeping networks fast and secure.  The project
welcomes partners to be successful together.

Muro(r) is based on FreeBSD 10 and is a fork of pfSense(r) which in its
turn is a fork of m0n0wall(r).

The next major release is 15.7 and is to be released on July 1st 2015.  Bug
fixes and security patches will be released when available.

We are looking forward to welcome you in the Muro community.

Because Open makes Sense!

The Muro core team
